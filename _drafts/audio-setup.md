## Impressions

**HD 6XX Headphones**: They sound exactly like the Sennheiser HD 650 which is exactly what everyone else says as well. By themselves they are already pretty good, clear but slightly dark/veiled. Very high impedance so an AMP is a must.

**Kanto YU2**: Decent sounding small speakers. I don't have much room for speakers so I had to get the best small speakers and these were the ones I chose. They looked identical to the Audioengine A2 speakers, so I decided to use the [DSP corrections by Noaudiophile](http://noaudiophile.com/DSP_Corrections/AudioEngine_A2_Plus.php) which improved their sound in my tests. The volume knob sits on the back of the left speaker which can be annoying to control by themselves. I left it around 50% and use my JDS Labs Switcher to control the volume instead.

**JDS Labs OL DAC**: A very neutral DAC. I didn't notice any sound differences, just cleaner sound without any buzzing. Completely USB powered and has a front button to switch between RCA and Optical inputs.

**Bottlehead Crack + Speedball**:

**JDS Labs OL Switcher**: A very useful piece of equipment to switch between my speakers and headphones through a flick of a switch. No need to plug/unplug anything to force the switch. Another nifty addition is the volume knob on the front which I always use.
