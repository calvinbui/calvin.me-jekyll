I signed up for a few trials before the Black Friday sales to test out some different providers and their download speeds.

<!-- more -->

## Testing Setup

* All testing was performed on NZBGet 17.1
* My maximum download speed is 100Mbp/s or 14MB/s which does not drop throughout the day.
* My internet connection is on cable provided by Telstra.
* All stats below from NZBGet's Statistics and Stats page which is reset when NZBGet is reloaded.
* All but one provider were tested on their free trial.
* Only providers with SSL were used.
* I used up all available connections advertised by the provider.

| Provider | Advertised (MB/s) | Real (MB/s) | Length | Downloaded | Notes
|--
| CheapNews | 15 | 5.46 | 1 year | 2.1TB | My old provider
| Usenet.Farm | N/A | 4.44 | 5 days | 7.5GB | 10GB Trial
| Giganews | N/A | 7.19 | 6 days | 10GB | 10GB Trial
| UsenetBucket | N/A | 11.8 | 7 days | 18GB | 7 Day / 25GB Trial
| TweakNews | 2.5 | 2.07 | 5 days | 10GB | 7 Day / 10GB Trial
| EasyNews | N/A | 13.5 | 14 days | 162GB | 14 Day / 10 GB Trial, which kept going
| Newsdemon | Unlimited | 11.1 | 15GB | 14GB | 15GB Trial
| Newsgroupdirect | Unlimited | 13.5 | 7 days | 50GB | EU servers @ 7MB/s
| Frugal | N/A | 13.0 | 7 days |  | EU servers @ 6.8MB/s

## Summary:

Best performers which saturated my 100Mbps / 14MBs connection were:

* Frugal
* EasyNews
* Newsdemon
* Newsgroupdirect
* UsenetBucket

I ended up signing with Frugal Usenet on their Black Friday special for $3.99 per month. I decided against the $40 a year in case of a rainy day over on the Highwinds network.
