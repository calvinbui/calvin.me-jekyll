Consider sending over PayPal using the above link. **There are fees involved and for this reason, I recommend Bitcoin.**

From Australia
- It's free to send money to me in Australia when you use your PayPal balance or bank account.
- If you use your credit or debit card, the fee is 2.4% + $0.30.

From Overseas
- Using your PayPal balance or linked bank account: From 0.5% - 3.3%, depending on the country
- Using your credit or debit card: From 3.9% - 7.4% plus a fixed fee, depending on the country
