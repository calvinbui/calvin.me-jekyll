UPDATE 18/10/16: Changed to support 10.12

For one reason or another you need macOS on ESXi tells you that it isn't possible unless your host is a Mac itself. That isn't particularly true...

## The ESXi Unlocker

Thanks to Donk over at InsanelyMac, a patch has been created to install macOS on ESXi  (5.5 only) but also supports Workstation (8, 9, 10), Player (4, 5, 6) and Fusion (4, 5, 6). [Have a look at it here](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/267296-esxi-5-mac-os-x-unlocker/) or try out version 2 which supports [Workstation 11, Player 7 Fusion 7 and ESXi 6](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/files/file/339-unlocker/).

_(Disclaimer: The following process potentially violates Apple’s End User License Agreement for macOS. Please check the Agreement before following these steps.)_

## Setup

Here is my current setup and what I have:

* Whitebox ESXi host
* macOS Sierra 10.12 (but any will work) - NOTE: lags heaps but can be [slightly tolerable with the beamoff application](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/302424-yosemite-on-vmware-unusable/).

## Install the Unlocker Patch

For this, I used the Windows vSphere client instead of the web client

**1.** Connect directly to your ESXi host instead of vCenter

**2.** Unzip the unlock-all-v130.zip file

**3.** Open a datastore (Configuration > Hardware > Storage) by right-clicking it and selecting 'Browse Datastore...'

**4.** Copy the 'esxi' folder to the datastore by selecting 'Upload Folder' making note of the warning of replacing any existing folders you may have with the same name

**5.** Enable and connect to SSH on the host (Configuration > Software > Security Profile > Services > Properties > SSH > Options > Start > OK)

**6.** Change directory over to your VMFS datastore

```terminal
$ cd /vmfs/volumes/[datastore]/
```

**7.** I recommend changing the name of the unlocker's folder to something else such as osx_unlocker

```terminal
$ mv esxi osx_unlocker
```

**8.** Go into the unlocker folder afterwards

```terminal
$ cd osx_unlocker
```

**9.** Make the install and uninstall file executable

```terminal
$ chmod +x *
```

**10.** Run the install script file

```terminal
$ ./install.sh
```

**11.** Reboot your ESXi host

## Create the ISO image

If you have 10.9 or greater, you will need a Mac to create the ISO.

#### **If you have a Mac or using 10.9 and greater**

For macOS or OS X 10.6 to 10.12, you can use this Mac only script to create the ISO if the InstallESD.img or Install.app is in the Applications folder: [https://gist.github.com/calvinbui/3cc1594d85583077a88d6d60eac01aa8](https://gist.github.com/calvinbui/3cc1594d85583077a88d6d60eac01aa8)

{% gist calvinbui/3cc1594d85583077a88d6d60eac01aa8 %}

#### Windows/Linux

Only supports 10.8 and below.

1. Download OS X installation however you wish. Apple provide it free on their Mac App Store such as this: [Yosemite Installation](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12)
2. Browse the 'Install OS X.app' and extract the InstallESD.dmg file under /Contents/SharedSupport/
3. Follow one of the options below depending on your operating system:

**Windows -** Convert the DMG file to an ISO using dmg2img. I used version 1.65.

```terminal
$ dmg2img -i InstallESD.img -o MountainLion.iso
```

**Linux (Ubuntu) -** Convert the DMG to ISO also using dmg2img (sudo_ apt-get install dmg2img_)

```terminal
$ dmg2img -i InstallESD.img -o MountainLion.iso
```

## Create the Virtual Machine and Install

Make sure to select Apple Mac OS X as your Guest Operating System.

Power on the VM and mount the ISO image to install.

If you get the error 'darwin11_64guest is not supported', try starting the VM directly from the host instead of vCenter.
