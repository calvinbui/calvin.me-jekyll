Some small tweaks here and there.

<!-- more -->

I was thinking this site was a bit ugly and it was mostly to do with the font and spacing. I created this theme myself and I'm definitely no design pro...but I can be at times.

Here are the subtle differences you can find:

* Fonts changed to Calibre
* Headings aren't as bold and weighty
* A touch of red on all links, with transitions!
* The ugly 'READ MORE >>' button is gone
* Line spacing increased

Here's the difference on the homepage. It's more welcoming and not in-your-face as before.

Here's the difference when on a post. The headings aren't as bold but you can still pick out sections from the improved line spacing.
