OpenCore bootloader configuration and files for the ASUS ROG STRIX Z270-I GAMING motherboard.

<!-- more -->

Over the weekend I played around with the [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) bootloader for Hackintosh. 

I've uploaded all my configs, ACPI, drivers and kexts to GitHub. [You can find it here](https://github.com/calvinbui/Asus-STRIX-Z270i-Hackintosh).

Everything _I needed_ worked for me. Things that aren't working but I won't look into fixing at the moment:

- USB Map: I enabled the `XhciPortLimit` option as a workaround
- Audio: I use a USB audio interface
- Wi-Fi: I use Ethernet
- Bluetooth: No Bluetooth devices
- NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti: Nothing I can do here until Apple and NVIDIA stop fighting.

All other details are on GitHub. Enjoy!
