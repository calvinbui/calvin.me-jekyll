My desktop is getting a bit long in the tooth. Time for a PC upgrade!

## Current System


The computer is fine per-se but lacks that gaming oomph when I need it. Sometimes I get put off playing games, usually AAA titles, because I can't get the highest settings possible at my optimal resolution. This has led me to play a lot of my games windowed (1600 x 900), which is actually pretty good since I'm left with my two other screens to do anything I need to. But now even games that are windowed are starting to give me some trouble =(

My current specs are as follows. A mini-ITX system (~17L) that I've had for roughly 3 years.

Too save myself some dough, I won't be looking at building a brand new system - but most parts will have to be replaced.



	
  * The Intel 2600K is still very good. Roughly 30% weaker than the new 6700K in benchmarks, but still good enough to not bottleneck the latest GPUs.

	
  * The H80 does a solid job. May be too much for my needs though as I don't overclock or strain the CPU too much.

	
  * My motherboard can still do a fantastic job but it is missing the capability to run SLI/XFire. It can do PCI Gen 3 that my CPU limits it to only Gen 2 but that doesn't make any difference at the moment.

	
  * 16GB of memory is already ballin'. I do have 32GB lying around though haha.

	
  * My SSD is doing just fine. Not worth an upgrade in my opinion. A few hundred dollars for a few seconds difference.

	
  * My HDD could do with an upgrade. Running games off of it can be quite slow. A 1TB SSD should reduce loading times greatly (like up to 80%).

	
  * The GTX 680 is very comparable to a GTX 960. This is the main area I need to work on and update.

	
  * The FT03 mini is a wonderful case case it saves so much room my being vertical. I will have to change it if I'm changing motherboards

	
  * The SFX PSU was bought just for the case. May be able to sell if off with it.




## Budget


Let's give myself $500 to work with. I don't want a brand new system, just some updates to various parts to make it better.

Fleabay, Gumtree, 2nd-hand forums here I come!


## Considerations


The most important aspects my desktop to me when upgrading will be:



	
  1. Size. Under 25L is a must. This means only mITX and mATX systems. My FT03 Mini is only ~17L.

	
  2. Noise. Easily achievable with Noctua fans, a very good fan controller and power supplies with fans that don't spin when idle.

	
  3. Performance. The reason I'm upgrading but I won't love the computer if it isn't quiet and small.




## What's Next?





	
  1. I need to really justify this upgrade to myself. $500 is still a lot of money to throw at a computer I use to play games once every often.

	
  2. Decide what the cheapest most powerful upgrade would be

	
  3. Plan the system out

	
  4. Begin purchases and Fleabay bids

	
  5. Post a Part 2 of what I've gotten so far!
