A look at all the mods I've thrown into my Oculus Quest all-in-one VR gaming headset.

<!-- more -->

I bought my Oculus Quest back in December during the [Amazon Prime Day sales for $719](https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/470990) before cashback. My only previous experience with VR has been over at a friend's place using the HTC Vive Pro.

# FrankenQuest (Vive DAS)

The first mod I installed was the FrankenQuest. The FrankenQuest is replacing the default strap with the [HTC Vive Deluxe Audio](https://www.vive.com/au/vive-deluxe-audio-strap/) strap. For the mod I made use of my 3D printer to create the side mounts and the top hook ring. Tyco Tech provides a [video of how to do the mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmnPnS4NOYo).

Over on Thingiverse, there is a [Vive DAS adapter by DarthOctane](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3691033) which connects to the original arms of the Oculus Quest.

For the top strap hook, I used this [design by DRAGONCITY_o](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3685188) with a few small zip ties.

# Studioform Creative Straps

I purchased both the [Quest Deluxe Strap](https://www.studioformcreative.com/product-page/go-quest-deluxe-strap-black) and [Apache DAS Strap](https://www.studioformcreative.com/) from Studioform Creative.

With both straps on at the same time, it feels like I'm wearing a baseball cap and the weight is evenly distributed across my head. My neck doesn't hurt from staring down for too long either.

# AMVR Beat Saber Handles

The AMVR Beat Saber Handles are good for playing Beat Saber with. I don't accidentally hit the PAUSE button anymore. I leave them on permanently even when playing other games. They are a little of a hassle when it comes to changing batteries.

While they can be bought from Amazon, I found them for a little cheaper on Ali Express.

# VR Cover Facial Interface

To improve comfort, I purchased the [VR Cover Facial Interface](https://vrcover.com/product/oculus-quest-foam-and-interface-basic-set/) along with some the [slim foam replacements](https://vrcover.com/product/oculus-quest-foam-replacement-slim/) and [cotton covers](https://vrcover.com/product/oculus-quest-vr-cover/). The best combination I have found is with the thicker foam replacement with the cotton cover. I wouldn't recommend the slim foam replacements unless you wanted some extra when sharing the device around with others.

# VR Cover Vive DAS Foam Replacement

Also from VR Cover, I purchased their [strap foam replacement for the HTC Vive Deluxe Audio Strap](https://vrcover.com/product/htc-vive-deluxe-audio-strap-foam-replacement/) as part of my FrankenQuest mod. I chose the thicker 20mm size and haven't had any issues with it.

# ToolPRO Safe Case

A safe case to store my Oculus Quest and all it's accessories. Most recommendations online are for Apache cases which are not available in Australia. The [ToolPRO Safe Case](https://www.supercheapauto.com.au/p/toolpro-toolpro-safe-case---345mm-x-290mm-x-145mm/326044.html) is available from Supercheap Auto for $50 and probably cheaper during their quarterly sales.

Inside I have all the mods listed including:
- 4 AA batteries
- Chromecast Ultra
- Sanitary masks
- 20000mAh Powerbank
